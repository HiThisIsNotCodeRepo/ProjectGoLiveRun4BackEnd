## Project Description
Due to Covid 19, an ad hoc job posting platform has emerged to provide more job opportunities, anyone can post their urgent task with personalised requirements ,for instance deliver food, buy necessity, send documents etc, it also needs to include max acceptable rate and expected delivery time. Anyone who is interested in making pocket money can bid for the job with their minimum acceptable rate and finish time. Among those service providers, job posters should pick one. Once a job is assigned, the service provider should do their best to complete the task before the deadline to avoid any penalty.
